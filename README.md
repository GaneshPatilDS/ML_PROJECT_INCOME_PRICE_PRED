# Adult Income Price Prediction Project
### This repository contains a project for predicting adult income prices. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the income level of an individual based on various features such as age, education, occupation, and more.

# Dataset
The project utilizes the Adult Income dataset, which consists of a collection of attributes describing individuals. The dataset contains both categorical and numerical features, making it suitable for training and evaluating machine learning algorithms.
